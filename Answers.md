State is data/information. Web apps are basically comprised of data (aka state), and things that change that data, or state.

1. Describe props.

Props are short for properties, props are read-only. When we want to pass information held on state inside one component to another component, we pass them as props.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

A side effect is anything that affects something outside the scope of the function being executed. Fetching data from an API, timers, logging, and manually manipulating the DOM are all examples of side effects.
